Stoplists source
----------------

1. Basque	
	
	http://apache.imsam.info/lucene/java/4.6.0/lucene-4.6.0-src.tgz 
		
	The stoplist is inside of the package: 
	
	lucene-4.6.0/analysis/common/src/resources/org/apache/lucene/analysis/eu/stopwords.txt
	
	NOTE: These stopwords seem to be incomplete (~100 entries).

	- Complete the stoplist for Basque (Alberto is working on that by January 17 2004)
 	- The junit included an instantiation of Swedish (se), but the file was not there. By now a new stoplist was added
